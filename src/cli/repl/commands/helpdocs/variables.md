# Variables

If you want to hold your values somewhere you can use `variables`. Variables are
just simple "keys" to access values that has been stored in the `environment`.
You can learn about it using the "/help environment" command. You can define a

1. Type definition binding:
   If you don't know about the types in `ralix` you can use
   "/help types" command to learn them about more.
   Here's an example:
   `str colon3 = ":3";`
2. Let binding:
   If you don't wanna learn about the types an be lazy,
   You can use let bindings. Let bindings automatically defines the type of the
   value you give.
   `let x = 3.14159 // gives the type "float"`
