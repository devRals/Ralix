# Ralix

Ralix is a simple, type-safe, tree-walking interpreter written in Rust. It is a hobby project, built to explore the concepts of building a programming language.

## Features

*   **Lexer**: A simple and efficient lexer that scans the source code and produces a stream of tokens.
*   **Parser**: A Pratt parser that builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the token stream.
*   **Type Checker**: A static type checker that verifies the correctness of the code before evaluation.
*   **Evaluator**: A tree-walking evaluator that traverses the AST to execute the code.
*   **REPL**: A Read-Eval-Print-Loop that allows for interactive programming.
*   **CLI**: A command-line interface to run scripts, inspect the AST, and use the REPL.

This book serves as the official documentation for the Ralix language and its interpreter.
